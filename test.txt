Hi! I am Masud.
I am 21.
I am from Panchagarh.
I love sleeping.
I am also lazy.
I want to work.

Then I move to Panchagarh for better opportunities.
But I got myselt disappointed.

Love and Respect go together.

But I get none.

I got myself admitted in SPS School & College in 2010.
It was an English version school.
It was so so.
